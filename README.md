# VacuumSensorDesign
A Vacuum Sesnor Design for Automotive applications
I'm too lazy to really write too much here. Basically in my search for telemtry from older cars for tuning and diagnostic purposes, I needed a manifold Vacuum Sensor that can be connected to SBC/MCU. Looking in the marketplace for equiv sensors there are few. and even looking in catalogs for raw sensors for this application there wasn't much in the way of vacuum sensors. the only equiv i found was the https://www.glowshiftdirect.com/vacuum-gauges/ looking at this one after i spent months searching for something i could build myself. shows that i basically picked the same sensor but from honeywell instead of NXP.

Basic specs
1. Read a vacuum signal from +/- 30psi (+/- 206KPa)
2. Output an protected MCU ADC value
3. Run on car voltages (12 volt pos ground) 
4. ability to be re-caled in the field if need be
