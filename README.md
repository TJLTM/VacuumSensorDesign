# VacuumSensorDesign
A Vacuum Sesnor Design for Automotive applications
I'm too lazy to really write too much here. Basically in my search for telemtry from older cars for tuning and diagnostic purposes, I needed a manifold Vacuum Sensor that can be connected to SBC/MCU. Looking in the marketplace for equiv sensors there are few. and even looking in catalogs for raw sensors for this application there wasn't much in the way of vacuum sensors. 

Basic requirements
1. Read a vacuum signal from -30 psi (-206KPa) to 0 psi/KPa
2. Output an protected MCU ADC value 
3. Run on car voltages 
4. ability to run on 3.3v or 5v 
5. ability to be re-caled in the field if need be
